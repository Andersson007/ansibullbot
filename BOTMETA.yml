# BOTMETA V2.0
#
# Data used by ansibot to identify who works on each file in the repo.
# If you have questions about this data format, please join #ansible-devel
# on irc.freenode and ping anyone who is op'ed.
#
# There are 3 primary sections of the data
#
#   automerge
#       During release freezes, the bot uses this key to know if
#       automerging should be on or off. It is a boolean value.
#
#   macros
#       Macros are used to shorten and group some strings and lists.
#       Any macro with a prefix of "team_" is a maintainer group for
#       various files.
#
#   files
#       Each key represents a specific file in the repository.
#       If a module is not listed, its maintainers default to the authors.
#       If the file has no maintainers key, the value of the key is
#       presumed to be the maintainers.
#
#       Keys:
#           maintainers - these people can shipit and automerge
#           notified - these people are always subscribed to relevant issues
#           ignored - these people should never be notified
#           deprecated - this file is deprecated but probably not yet renamed
#           keywords - used to identify this file based on the issue description
#           migrated_to - If this has been migrated to Galaxy, in the form collection.namespace
#                         see https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections.html
#           support - used for files without internal ANSIBLE_METADATA, see
#                     https://github.com/ansible/ansible/labels?q=support for full list
#           labels - list of GitHub labels to apply. Path components of 'file' parent key
#                    which are valid GitHub labels are automatically added.
#           supershipit - supershipiteers can turn a shipit into a supershipit
#
